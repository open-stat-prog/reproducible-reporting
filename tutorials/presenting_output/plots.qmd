Figures are essential for visualizing data, illustrating concepts, or enhancing your reports. Quarto supports **figures generated from R code** as well as **external images**, allowing you to control captions, size, and placement for a polished presentation.


## Figures Generated from R

When creating plots in R, you can add **captions** and **adjust figure size** using chunk options in Quarto.

The options within your R chunk would be set like this:

````markdown
#| label: fig-scores
#| fig-cap: "Boxplot of scores by group"
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 4
````
And with the following R code: 
```{r}
#| label: fig-scores
#| fig-cap: "Boxplot of scores by group"
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 4

library(ggplot2)

data <- data.frame(
  Group = c("A", "B", "C"),
  Score = c(5.2, 6.8, 4.9)
)

ggplot(data, aes(x = Group, y = Score, fill = Group)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_minimal()
```

This would then result in the figure as directly outputted after the code. Here, you see:

* `fig-cap`: Adds a **caption** to the figure.
* `fig-width` and `fig-height`: Control the **size of the rendered figure** (in inches for HTML/PDF).
* `label`: Allows you to **cross-reference** the figure in text with `@fig-scores`: Ref to @fig-scores.

You can also combine `fig-align: "center"` in the chunk to **center the figure** in the output.


## 2. External Images

Quarto can include images stored locally or from the web using **Markdown syntax**:

### Local images:

Local images can be presented as follows:

```markdown
![This is a local image caption](/assets/images/ecrins_pano.jpg){#fig-local width=50%}
```

![This is a local image caption](/assets/images/ecrins_pano.jpg){#fig-local width=50%}

* `{#fig-local}`: Assigns a **label** for cross-referencing using `@fig-local`: @fig-local. 
* `width=50%`: Adjusts the display size relative to the output width.

### Web images:

Web images can be presented by linking to them directly:

```markdown
![Quarto logo](https://quarto.org/quarto.png){width=200px}
```

![Quarto logo](https://quarto.org/quarto.png){width=200px}

* Directly embeds an image from a URL.
* Can adjust size using `width` or `height`.
* Captions can be added, but for HTML output, you may need to style with CSS for advanced formatting.

### Best Practices for Figures

1. **Always add captions**: Makes figures self-contained and referenceable.
2. **Label your figures**: Use `#| label:` for R plots or `{#fig-label}` for Markdown images to enable cross-referencing.
3. **Adjust sizes thoughtfully**: Use `fig-width`/`fig-height` or CSS/Markdown size attributes to make sure figures are readable.
4. **Use consistent styling**: Keep themes, fonts, and color schemes consistent across all figures for a professional look.
5. **Prefer vector graphics for clarity**: When possible, export PDF/SVG plots for crisp rendering in reports.


## Combining Inline References with Figures

Once a figure is labeled, you can refer to it in the text dynamically:

```markdown
As shown in @fig-scores, group B has the highest score.
```
Which will look as follows in text: As shown in @fig-scores, group B has the highest score.

Quarto will automatically number the figure in the rendered document.


This approach allows you to seamlessly integrate **data-driven plots**, **static images**, and **online resources** while keeping your figures clean, readable, and fully reproducible.
