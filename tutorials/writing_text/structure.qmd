A well-structured Quarto document helps readers follow your analysis and allows Quarto to automatically generate tables of contents, numbered sections, and cross-references. You can add structure using **headings**, **numbered elements** (sections, figures, and equations), and **citations** or **cross-references**.

## Headings and Subheadings

Headings in Quarto follow the standard Markdown syntax using one or more hash (`#`) symbols. A single `#` creates a top-level heading, `##` creates a subheading, and so on.

```markdown
# Main Title

## Section Title

### Subsection Title
```

Which would result in: 

# Main Title

## Section Title

### Subsection Title


Quarto automatically interprets these heading levels to build a **document hierarchy**. This structure is reflected in the output and (if enabled) in a **table of contents** (`toc: true` in the YAML front matter).

For example, adding the following to your YAML header will generate an automatic table of contents based on your headings:

```yaml
---
title: "My Analysis Report"
toc: true
number-sections: true
---
```

When `number-sections: true` is set, all headings are automatically numbered (`1`, `1.1`, `1.2`, etc.), and cross-references can be created for each section.


### Numbering Figures and Equations

Quarto automatically numbers **figures**, **tables**, and **equations** that have captions. This numbering enables you to refer to them consistently throughout your text.

To number a **figure**, simply add a caption using the `fig-cap` option:

````markdown
#| label: fig-distribution
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of scores by group."
library(ggplot)

ggplot(data, aes(x = group, y = score, fill = group)) +
  geom_boxplot()
````

See below how this caption will appear in addition to the figure:

```{r}
#| label: fig-distribution
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of scores by group."
#| echo: FALSE

library(ggplot2)

set.seed(123)
data <- data.frame(
  group = rep(c("A", "B"), each = 10),
  score = c(rnorm(10, mean = 75, sd = 5),
            rnorm(10, mean = 82, sd = 6))
)


ggplot(data, aes(x = group, y = score, fill = group)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

To reference it in text, use the label you assigned:
`See @fig-distribution for an overview of the score distributions.` would result in: See @fig-distribution for an overview of the score distributions.

For **equations**, numbering occurs when you assign a label inside the LaTeX math block:

```markdown
$$
E = mc^2 \quad
$$ {#eq-myequation}
```

$$
E = mc^2 \quad 
$$ {#eq-myequation}

You can then refer to this equation as `@eq-myequation` in your text, which will render as “(1)” or “Equation 1” depending on the format. Here it results in: @eq-myequation. 


## Numbering Sections

When you include `number-sections: true` in your YAML front matter, Quarto automatically numbers all top-level and nested headings. This is especially useful in reports, theses, or papers where hierarchical organization matters. The numbering adjusts dynamically as you add or rearrange content, ensuring consistent structure throughout the document.


## Adding References and Citations

Quarto uses **Pandoc’s citation system**, allowing you to cite sources from a bibliography file. In your YAML header, include the path to a `.bib` file (in BibTeX format):

```yaml
---
title: "My Report"
bibliography: references.bib
---
```

You can then cite works in-text using the `@` symbol and the citation key from your `.bib` file:
`As shown in @smith2021, the results confirm the hypothesis.`

To include a **list of references** (a bibliography) at the end of your document, simply add a `# References` heading — Quarto will automatically populate it during rendering.

Example of inline citations:

* `@smith2021` →  @smith2021
* `[@smith2021; @doe2022]` → [@smith2021; @doe2022]
